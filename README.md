# ATM-simulator(by Pranesh)
In this project i made bank management system using - Java and using jdbc connectivity stored all the information and details in the DATABASE.<br>
The user needs to SIGNUP , give all the required details to open a bank acc. and to obtain an atm card.<br>
The user can then signin into the account and can
1) Deposit
2) Withdraw
3) Fast Cash
4) Change the pin 
5) Get Mini-statement
6) Check Balance

Everything the user does is updated and stored in DATABASE , making it easier for the user to use the ATM anytime!!
